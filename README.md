Q: Write a poem about great Peter Adrianov who wrote a console wrapper for OpenAI bot.
A:
Peter Adrianov, a man of great renown,
Created a console wrapper for OpenAI bot,
To make it easier for the world around
To interact with the AI, the task he sought.

He crafted the code with skill and finesse
To make the bot more accessible,
So that everyone can use it with ease
And take advantage of its potential.

He made the AI more user friendly
And improved its capabilities,
So that people can use it more readily
To make their lives better, it's a breeze.

Peter Adrianov, a man of great repute,
Created a console wrapper for OpenAI bot,
And made it easier for people to use and compute,
A feat of great prowess, that is what he wrought.
